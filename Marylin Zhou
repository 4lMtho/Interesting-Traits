## About Me

- I'm not as disciplined or smart as people think, but I try my best anyway.
- I'm a massive fan of K-pop, C-pop, J-pop, K-dramas, C-dramas, and Short dramas — basically anything emotional and binge-worthy.
- I'm allergic to almost half the planet, but thankfully nothing life-threatening (yet).
- Long focus sessions are a challenge for me — but coffee, music, and goals keep me going.
